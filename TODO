DONE one logfile per device (IMEI)
- more specific mqtt pubs for, say, battery (/status)

DONE cdb for names, data, extra.json, etc. with a small utility to create/edit that data

In order to detect whether a device has gone offline:
  - whenever I get a HBD or a position for a device, update the IMEI's
    entry in conns_by_imei for that device (set a timestamp = now())
  - periodically (mongoose timer?) check that each of the connections
    had done something; if no activity for 15 minutes, close the TCP
    connection and produce an MQTT LWT for that IMEI in order to inform
    Traccar that the device has gone away
